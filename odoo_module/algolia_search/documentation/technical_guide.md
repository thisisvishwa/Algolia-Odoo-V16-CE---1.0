A visually appealing search results page is designed in the `templates.xml` and `algolia_search.xml` files. The displayed information can be configured via the Odoo Backend module.

## Mobile Responsiveness
The search functionality is optimized for mobile devices to provide a consistent user experience. This is done in the `algolia_search.css` CSS file.

## Odoo Version Compatibility
The integration is ensured to be compatible with Odoo Version 16 Community Edition. This is checked in the `__manifest__.py` file.
